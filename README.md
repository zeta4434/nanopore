# nanopore
The Nanopore K-mer Signal Analysis Toolkit delivers a complete, reproducible pipeline for quantifying and interpreting the relationship between Oxford Nanopore ionic-current signals and underlying nucleotide context. Using curated 6-mer and 9-mer training sets, the suite encodes sequences through one-hot vectors, trains gradient-boosted decision trees (XGBoost) and linear models, and produces high-resolution visual diagnostics designed for publication. Comprehensive evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²) are computed with nested cross-validation, while SHAP explainability modules decompose individual predictions into base-specific contributions, generate global feature-importance rankings, and reveal synergistic effects via interaction plots. Residual analyses, sliding-window alignment utilities, and Δ-current heat-maps support rigorous model validation and discovery of sequence motifs that modulate pore conductance.
